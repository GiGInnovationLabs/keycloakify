### Seeing the result live

When building your page you want to see the result of your edit live. &#x20;

To acheave that with Keycloakify simply eddit: &#x20;

```diff
 import { getKcContext } from "keycloakify";

 const { kcContext } = getKcContext({
+    "mockPageId": "login.ftl"
 });
```

then if you run yarn start you will see your login page display (Dont forget to remove mockPageId before releasing ðŸ˜‰). &#x20;

The page is loaded with a default mock context. To customize the mock kcContext please refer to [this example](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app/blob/a316ea0046976e6d435a33e896cb9e3d1873c124/src/KcApp/kcContext.ts#L28-L78).

### Testing in a real Keycloak instance

Once you are done developping you want to test in an actual Keycloak instance to see if everything is working as expected. &#x20;

Please refer to the related instruction printed on the console when running `yarn keycloak` in your project.
