# üèÅ Requirements

On Windows OS you'll have to use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). More info [here](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/keycloakify/issues/54#issuecomment-984834217)

Tested with the following Keycloak versions:

* [11.0.3](https://hub.docker.com/layers/jboss/keycloak/11.0.3/images/sha256-4438f1e51c1369371cb807dffa526e1208086b3ebb9cab009830a178de949782?context=explore)
* [12.0.4](https://hub.docker.com/layers/jboss/keycloak/12.0.4/images/sha256-67e0c88e69bd0c7aef972c40bdeb558a974013a28b3668ca790ed63a04d70584?context=explore)
* [15.0.2](https://hub.docker.com/layers/jboss/keycloak/15.0.2/images/sha256-d8ed1ee5df42a178c341f924377da75db49eab08ea9f058ff39a8ed7ee05ec93?context=explore)
* [16.1.0](https://hub.docker.com/layers/jboss/keycloak/16.1.0/images/sha256-6ecb9492224c6cfbb55d43f64a5ab634145d8cc1eba14eae8c37e3afde89546e?context=explore)
* 17.0.1

This tool will be maintained to stay compatible with Keycloak v11 and up, however, the default pages you will get (before you customize it) will always be the ones of Keycloak v11.

This tool assumes you are bundling your app with Webpack (tested with the versions that ships with CRA v4.44.2 and v5.0.0) . It assumes there is a `build/` directory at the root of your react project directory containing a `index.html` file and a `build/static/` directory generated by webpack.&#x20;

For more information see [this issue](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/keycloakify/issues/5#issuecomment-832296432).

**All this is defaults with** [**`create-react-app`**](https://create-react-app.dev) (tested with 5.0.0, 4.0.3)

* `mvn` ([Maven](https://maven.apache.org)), `rm`, `mkdir`, `curl`, `unzip` are assumed to be available.
* `docker` must be up and running when running `start_keycloak_testing_container.sh` (Instructions provided after running `yarn keycloak`).

#### My framework doesn‚Äôt seem to be supported, what can I do?

Currently Keycloakify is only compatible with SPA React apps. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you can't use Keycloakify if you are using Next.js, Express or any other framework that involves a server but your Keycloak theme will need to be a standalone project.\
Find specific instructions about how to get started [**here**](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app#keycloak-theme-only).

To share your styles between your main app and your login pages you will need to externalize your design system by making it a separate module. Checkout [ts\_ci](https://github.com/garronej/ts\_ci), it can help with that (example with [our design system](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-ui)).
