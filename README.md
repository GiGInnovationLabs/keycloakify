This tool will be maintained to stay compatible with every Keycloak version starting from [Keycloak Version 11](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/tag/11.0.3).

However, the default pages you will get (before you customize them) will always be the ones of Keycloak [v11.0.3](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/tag/11.0.3).

### Supported React frameworks

{% hint style="success" %}
If you want to make your life easy use [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev) and start from one of the template repos:&#x20;

* [keycloakify-demo-app with CSS only configuration](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app).
* [keycloakify-demo-app with component level configuration](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app/tree/look\_and\_feel).
{% endhint %}





### Utility that needs to be installed

* `mvn` ([Maven](https://maven.apache.org)), `rm`, `mkdir`, `curl`, `unzip` are assumed to be available.
* `docker` must be up and running when running `start_keycloak_testing_container.sh` (Instructions provided after running `yarn keycloak`).

This tool assumes you are bundling your app with Webpack (tested with the versions that ships with CRA v4.44.2 and v5.0.0) . It assumes there is a `build/` directory at the root of your react project directory containing a `index.html` file and a `build/static/` directory generated by webpack.&#x20;

For more information see [this issue](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/keycloakify/issues/5#issuecomment-832296432).

**All this is defaults with** [**`create-react-app`**](https://create-react-app.dev) (tested with 5.0.0, 4.0.3)

* `mvn` ([Maven](https://maven.apache.org)), `rm`, `mkdir`, `curl`, `unzip` are assumed to be available.
* `docker` must be up and running when running `start_keycloak_testing_container.sh` (Instructions provided after running `yarn keycloak`).

#### My framework doesn‚Äôt seem to be supported, what can I do?

Currently Keycloakify is only compatible with SPA React apps. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you can't use Keycloakify if you are using Next.js, Express or any other framework that involves a server but your Keycloak theme will need to be a standalone project.\
Find specific instructions about how to get started [**here**](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app#keycloak-theme-only).

To share your styles between your main app and your login pages you will need to externalize your design system by making it a separate module. Checkout [ts\_ci](https://github.com/garronej/ts\_ci), it can help with that (example with [our design system](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-ui)).
